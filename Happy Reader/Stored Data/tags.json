Because trampling can be used to produce pain, the trampling fetish for some adherents is closely linked to sadomasochistic fetishism.\n\nThe most common form of trampling is done by a female (in rare situations by a male) walking on a male or female submissive and is usually done barefooted, in socks, nylons, or shoes. The trampler will predominantly walk, jump and stomp on the person's back, chest, stomach, genitalia and face.\n\n[url=https://s.vndb.org/sf/84/87684.jpg]NSFW Example[/url]","aliases":["Walk Over Someone's Body"],"name":"Trampling","cat":"ero"},{"cat":"ero","name":"In-game Sexual Content Toggle","aliases":["Optional Sexual Content","Stop Sex Scenes","Toggle Sexual Content"],"description":"A visual novel with this tag has an in-game mechanic that allow players to disable/enable sexual content before or as it appears.\n\nFor example, players can adjust this in the title's setting menu and/or a designated button near the text box during reading.\n\nThis can result in sexual scenes being removed altogether or the ability to censor particular sexual scenes as they appear.\n\n\n**IMPORTANT NOTE: This tag is for *in-game* sexual content toggling ONLY. *Do not* tag visual novels with a \"no sexual content patch\", \"all-ages version patch\", etc. - those are to be specified in the releases section of a visual novel only!**","meta":true,"id":2708,"vns":12,"parents":[582]},{"description":"These games feature characters that can transform into other forms including animals, objects, etc.","meta":true,"id":1188,"parents":[6],"vns":104,"cat":"cont","aliases":["Animorph","Transformation"],"name":"Shapeshifting"},{"meta":true,"id":105,"vns":1577,"parents":[1],"description":"Science Fiction (Hard or Soft) is an important Element of these games.","aliases":[],"name":"Science Fiction","cat":"cont"},{"aliases":["Fictional Modern Day Japanese City","Fictional Contemporary Japanese City","Fictional Contemporary Japanese Town"],"name":"Fictional Modern Day Japanese Town","cat":"cont","id":222,"meta":true,"vns":255,"parents":[221,1830],"description":"This visual novel is set in a fictional town within contemporary Japan."},{"description":"A game tagged with this tag has a hero who for the majority of the game possesses an ahoge.

They just need to act like a boke in their everyday life. For example, their airheadedness may be a source of humor throughout the story.\n\nSimilar in execution to the concepts of \"funny man\" and \"straight man\" in double act comedy, boke and tsukkomi are a very important characteristic of manzai (Japanese style of comedy). Boke comes from the verb bokeru which carries the meaning of \"senility\" or \"air headed-ness\" and is reflected in the boke's tendency for misinterpretation and forgetfulness. The word tsukkomi refers to the role the second comedian plays in \"butting in\" and correcting the boke's errors. In performances it is common for the tsukkomi to berate the boke and hit them on the head with a swift smack; one traditional manzai prop often used for this purpose is a pleated paper fan.\n\nSee [url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manzai]Wikipedia[/url] and [url=http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BokeAndTsukkomiRoutine]tvtropes[/url] for further reading.","meta":true,"id":1604,"parents":[403],"vns":23},{"parents":[1094],"vns":34,"id":2291,"meta":true,"description":"The game contains at least one scene that features armpit licking.\n\nArmpit licking as the name states is the act of licking the armpit of a person.
