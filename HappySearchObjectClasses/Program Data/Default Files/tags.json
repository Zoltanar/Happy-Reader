Boke comes from the verb bokeru which carries the meaning of \"senility\" or \"air headed-ness\" and is reflected in the boke's tendency for misinterpretation and forgetfulness. The word tsukkomi refers to the role the second comedian plays in \"butting in\" and correcting the boke's errors. In performances it is common for the tsukkomi to berate the boke and hit them on the head with a swift smack; one traditional manzai prop often used for this purpose is a pleated paper fan.\n\nSee [url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manzai]Wikipedia[/url] and [url=http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BokeAndTsukkomiRoutine]tvtropes[/url] for further reading.","id":1603,"aliases":[],"parents":[403]},{"name":"Author Commentary","meta":true,"cat":"tech","vns":2,"parents":[675],"aliases":["Commentary track"],"id":2402,"description":"This game has an optional commentary mode, allowing you to play the game with interjections from the writer/staff."},{"vns":190,"name":"Torture","cat":"cont","meta":true,"id":942,"description":"This game features scenes of [url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torture]torture[/url].\n\nThese scenes are not required to be graphically depicted.\n\nAim of the tag is to mark the presence of scenes of severe pain or suffering, whether physical or mental, being intentionally inflicted on people are present in this game somewhere.","parents":[360],"aliases":[]},{"vns":134,"cat":"cont","meta":true,"name":"Dojikko Heroine","description":"One or more heroines in this game is a [url=http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Dojikko]dojikko[/url].","id":726,"parents":[385],"aliases":["Clumsy but cute heroine"]},{"name":"Mercenary Support Character","cat":"cont","meta":true,"vns":9,"parents":[239],"aliases":[],"id":1416,"description":"At least one of this game's support characters is (or was) a [url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercenary]mercenary[/url].\n\nA mercenary is a person who takes part in an armed conflict, who is not a national or a party to the conflict, and is \"motivated to take part in the hostilities essentially by the desire for private gain and, in fact, is promised, by or on behalf of a party to the conflict, material compensation substantially in excess of that promised or paid to combatants of similar ranks and functions in the armed forces of that Party\"."},{"cat":"ero","meta":true,"name":"Hidden Vibrator","vns":379,"parents":[721],"aliases":[],"description":"This story features scenes where a character uses or is forced/tricked into using a vibrator in secret during every day activities, for example while at work, at school, eating dinner, etc.","id":727},{"vns":4,"name":"Feeder Fetish","cat":"cont","meta":true,"description":"Characters in this visual novel derive pleasure from eating lots of food to gain weight, or from feeding others to cause them to gain weight.\n\nThe story and imagery focuses on the act of feeding and weight gain, not simply the presence of fat characters.","id":1945,"parents":[360],"aliases":["Feederism","Feedism"]},{"vns":106,"name":"Slice of Life Drama","meta":true,"cat":"cont","id":453,"description":"This tag is for slice of life stories of dramatic nature.","parents":[147,454],"aliases":["Realist Drama"]},{"aliases":[],"parents":[27],"description":"These games have only a single ending.","id":146,"meta":true,"cat":"tech","name":"Single Ending","vns":1504},{"description":"Comedy is an important element of these games.","id":104,"parents":[1],"aliases":[],"vns":2445,"meta":true,"cat":"cont","name":"Comedy"},{"parents":[497],"aliases":["Heroine with Split Personality"],"id":290,"description":"One or or more of the heroines has multiple personalities - this might have psychological causes, or be a real second personality.\n\nWhile modern Tsundere appear to be this at times, they don't qualify.","name":"Heroine with Multiple Personalities","cat":"cont","meta":true,"vns":94},{"aliases":[],"parents":[375],"id":1032,"description":"One or more heroines is an [url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineer]engineer[/url].","cat":"cont","meta":true,"name":"Engineer Heroine","vns":14},{"parents":[881],"aliases":["Junior High School Student Hero"],"description":"At least one of the heroes is a junior high school student.","id":2297,"name":"Middle School Student Hero","cat":"cont","meta":true,"vns":5},{"id":446,"description":"The protagonist of this visual novel is a [url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacker_%28term%29]hacker[/url].","aliases":[],"parents":[404,543],"vns":13,"cat":"cont","meta":true,"name":"Hacker Protagonist"},{"meta":true,"cat":"cont","name":"Heroine with Gothic Look","vns":109,"aliases":[],"parents":[854],"description":"One or more heroines in this game are mostly dressed in [url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gothic_fashion]gothic fashion[/url].","id":527},{"vns":5,"meta":true,"cat":"ero","name":"Triple Footjob","id":2242,"description":"The game contains at least one scene that features a [url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Footjob]footjob[/url] performed by three people at once.\n\nA footjob refers to sexual practice with the feet.
