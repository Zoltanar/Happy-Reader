0 - test tab: list entries used per stage.
0 - warn if an instance is already running (maybe show database file for opening instance)
0 - launch title from VN context menu
0 - CachedTranslations: option to do this automatically: remove from cache if not used recently or originally cached too long ago.
0 - show written tag description on tooltip
0 - staff filter by name instead of id
0 - add seiyuu filter to character
0 - allow scrolling on main window tab control when too many tabs and add close all tabs button
0 - TestTab: show if translation was cached or not and give option to re-fetch
0 - report error when setting google credential path
0 - use ithvnr tab to also show captured clipboard text format like: [process/pid] [outputted] [text]
0 - outputwindow: add entry from selected text should default type to output when latin only.
0 - ithvnr: better saving/loading game text threads, let user name threads and delete saved
0 - ithvnr: once any thread has been saved as posting, change default for new threads to stop/hide.
0 - vnrhook: handle maximum threads either change limit or reset ability
0 - allow proxy mods with multiple proxies ([[m#1]]-[[m#2]])
0 - cached translations: save source name (for now only google free and google credential)
0 - check if output window is in visible area of screens, if not, reset it.

before release:
set up database versioning/upgrade system

look at global hooks for managing infinite text via global hotkeys, etc (https://github.com/gmamaladze/globalmousekeyhook)
allow keeping time played for multiple games
allow monitor to keep running always
make monitor only have one instance.
apply translate stage 4 to pre-romaji
if response is error with id 'needlogin' show user that credentials are wrong
offline dictionary for faster (mouseover?) word lookups

great outstanding problems:
can't show outputwindow on top of some fullscreen games, steals focus on games where it works
