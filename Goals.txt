before release:
set up database versioning/upgrade system

look at global hooks for managing infinite text via global hotkeys, etc (https://github.com/gmamaladze/globalmousekeyhook)
allow keeping time played for multiple games
allow monitor to keep running always
make monitor only have one instance.
apply translate stage 4 to pre-romaji
if response is error with id 'needlogin' show user that credentials are wrong
offline dictionary for faster (mouseover?) word lookups

great outstanding problems:
can't show outputwindow on top of some fullscreen games, steals focus on games where it works
